our steps

first of all we added fourth section as required 

then the decliration of the global variables in javascript

then creating list items and anchors then appending both stored in a fragment

now we have our links appended in the screen then we added a addEventListener() to the window to give the selected section background using the getBpundingClientRect() method by giving the viewed section an active class called(your-active-class) 

then we selected every link to check if the data-nav equals to the textcontent of the links if true give that link a gray background

then we used media query to make the landing page responsive with phones,tablets,desktops.
